# Multicluster Manifests

Kustomize manifests to support the multicluster tutorials and demos. These are
laid out as follows:

- `base` - Take the
  [podinfo](https://github.com/stefanprodan/podinfo/tree/master/kustomize)
  manifest and add namespaces.
- `remote1` - Modify the color and naming.
- `remote2` - Modify the color and naming.
